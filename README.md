This project provides a practical implementation of sales prediction using machine learning algorithms. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can gain insights into the predictive modeling process and understand the impact of different features and algorithms on sales prediction.
* Missing values:
This repository contains code for handling missing data in a given dataset and building two machine learning models for a classification problem. The performance of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is compared. 
* Pima diabetes pred:
Predicting Diabetes Onset: This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on Kaggle. The project has produced plots and visualizations illustrating the dataset's characteristics, feature importance, model performance metrics, and possibly decision boundaries. Evaluation metrics is displayed and interpreted to assess the effectiveness of the trained models.
* water potability:
This project aims to predict the quality of water using machine learning techniques. By implementing logistic regression and random forest classifier, the quality of water with certain accuracy was able to be predicted. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in assessing water quality, which can have significant implications in public health and environmental conservation.
